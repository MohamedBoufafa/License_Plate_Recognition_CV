# 🚀 NEXT STEPS: From Data Generation to OCR Training

## ✅ What You've Completed

1. ✅ **Synthetic plate generator** (50,000 plates)
2. ✅ **Real dataset** (~1,500 plates in `recognition/`)
3. ✅ **Data mixing strategy** documented

---

## ⏭️ What Comes Next

### **PHASE 1: Mix Datasets** (1 hour)

**Goal:** Combine synthetic + real plates with proper ratio

**What to do:**
1. Upload `synthetic_plates.zip` to Kaggle as dataset
2. Upload `recognition/` folder to Kaggle as dataset
3. Create new Kaggle notebook: "OCR Data Preparation"
4. Follow `DATA_MIXING_STRATEGY.md` guide
5. Create mixed train/val/test splits (80% synthetic, 20% real)

**Output:** 
- Combined dataset ready for training
- ~40,000 training images (80% synth + 20% real)

---

### **PHASE 2: Implement Augmentation** (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Add heavy augmentation for real-world robustness

**What to do:**
1. Install Albumentations: `!pip install albumentations`
2. Create augmentation pipelines:
   - Heavy (for real images): Rotation, perspective, blur, noise
   - Medium (for synthetic): Light rotation, brightness
   - None (for validation): Just resize
3. Test on sample images to verify quality

**Key augmentations:**
- ✅ Rotation (±15°)
- ✅ Perspective transform
- ✅ Brightness/Contrast (±30%)
- ✅ Blur (Gaussian + Motion)
- ✅ Noise (Gaussian)

---

### **PHASE 3: Build OCR Model** (Next session)

**Goal:** Create CRNN architecture for OCR

**What you'll need:**
1. **Model architecture:**
   - CNN backbone (extract features)
   - RNN/LSTM (sequence modeling)
   - CTC decoder (output text)

2. **Training setup:**
   - CTC Loss function
   - Adam optimizer
   - Learning rate schedule
   - Early stopping

3. **Evaluation metrics:**
   - Character accuracy
   - Sequence accuracy (most important!)
   - Edit distance

**See:** `OCR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for complete details

**While implementing:**
3. Code examples in DATA_MIXING_STRATEGY.md
4. Albumentations documentation (for augmentation)

**For training:**
5. `OCR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Complete guide)
6. Phase 5: CTC Loss section (critical!)

## ❓ Quick Q&A

**Q: Should I mix synthetic and real datasets?**
**A:** YES! Use 80% synthetic + 20% real for optimal results.

**Q: Do I need augmentation if I have 50k synthetic plates?**
**A:** YES! Augmentation simulates real-world conditions (rotation, lighting, blur).

**Q: Which augmentation for real vs synthetic?**
**A:** Heavy for real (limited data), Medium for synthetic (already varied).

**Q: Where to train?**
**A:** Kaggle (free GPU, 9-hour sessions, perfect for OCR training).

**Q: What if mixing ratios don't work?**
**A:** Start with 80/20. If model doesn't generalize → increase real%. If overfits → increase synthetic%.
